# Quantum-TicTacToe
This is a semestral project that I'm realising during 4th semester of studies. The aim of the project is to program a game that will allow two players (at
one device) play every well-known game Tic-Tac-Toe, however in a quantum version. Initially, the game will be made in the terminal version (displaying the board and selecting fields will be done using the terminal). After the "terminal" version is finished the game will be expanded with a graphical interface (GUI).

Rules:
1. Each round one player put small two marks, which are numbered same as round e.g. It's first round (time for player X), so he'll put two x1 marks
2. You can't place two small marks during round in the same tile.
3. When after one player's move occures entanglement then second player choose tile and mark to be collapsed here.
4. Collapsed tiles with chosen mark evolve to big marks.
5. To win a game you have to place three big marks in horizontal/vertical/diagonal line (same as classical tic-tac-toe).
Good luck!!!
