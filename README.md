# Quantum-TicTacToe
This is a semestral project that I'm realising during 4th semester of studies. The aim of the project is to program a game that will allow two players (at
one device) play every well-known game Tic-Tac-Toe, however in a quantum version. Initially, the game will be made in the terminal version (displaying the board and selecting fields will be done using the terminal). After the "terminal" version is finished the game will be expanded with a graphical interface (GUI).


Below example of a few moves:
